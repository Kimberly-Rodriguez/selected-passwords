# Selected Password Project

For this project, I used starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on a number of key criterias. The application shows compelling HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

This password generator (selected-password-project) generates a password that meets certain criterias guided by users. Thus creating a strong password that provides greater security.


## 

The secure password is created whe the user clicks the button to generate a password and then the user is presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.

Once prompted for password criteria then the user selects which criteria to include in the password, some of these include:

     - prompted for the length of the password (at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters)
     - whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
     - each prompt should be answer with a true statement

Futher, the input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected -- generating a password that uses the seled criteria.

Finally, once the password is generated then the password is displayed to the page.

Some complications included: creating a group array that populated and aggregated the correct values to the selected criteria "if then" statements, as well as merging the group arrays with the final empty array, and creating an alert notication if the user was only generating false statements.
